--> Run with LAMMPS (19 May 2017)
--> Must be run on AT LEAST 16 mpi ranks

Make sure to update the path to your LAMMPS exec in submit-temper.bash

Set last to 0 before running,

  echo 0 > last

This will start gREM from the begining, with all replicas initialized with "init_file_file" 

NOTE: The lambda and eta used in this example are NOT optimized for the most efficient sampling.
